# MakeCode Arcade smart shield firmware

Firmware for shields with screen/buttons that enable MakeCode Arcade.
The shield drives the screen (in particular it can bit-bang a 320x240 parallel
connection screen).

This firmware is just an example. Shield manufactures can use it a base for their own development.

## Build instructions

Checkout pxt-common-packages at `smart_screen` branch. Symlink it in the main folder here.
To be added as sub-module as soon as it stabilizes.
